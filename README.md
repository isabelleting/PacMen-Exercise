# PacMen Exercise

## Description 

A fun game with MIT xPro where you can add many PacMan and have them bounce around the browser window at different velocities.  

## How To Run

After loading in a browser window, click Add PacMan to add as many as you like. Click Start Game to get them going and click again if you want them to speed up.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

I would like to have each Add PacMan click generate a random color PacMan and add fruits to the game as well.
